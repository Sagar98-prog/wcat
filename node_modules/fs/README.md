WCAT (Web Capacity Analysis Tool) is a tiny but excellent tool from Microsoft to perform load test on your web application on IIS. This tool enables you to do performance analysis on various scenarios of your web application. All “perfmon” performance counters (like processor time, private bytes usage, disk queue length, total bytes sent or received in network) can be specified for the performance testing. A performance test is for a business scenario, hence a test needs to include all servers (application server, database server) involved in the business scenario. This is tool is as handy as possible to perform a load test even on a single machine.

Once you specify the scenario in your application (i.e., appropriate URLs), a number of virtual clients from various client machines will visit the URL with appropriate request data. Like other performance tools, the following players are involved in performance testing:

Server – Machines on which your web application components are running
Client – A virtual client on a machine which acts as end-user to visit the URL
Controller – This coordinates a test among the virtual clients on various machines. It also captures and collates the performance counters from appropriate servers.
